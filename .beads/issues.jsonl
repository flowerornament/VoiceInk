{"id":"VoiceInk-9lk","title":"Debug remaining UI choppiness in mini recorder transitions","description":"## Problem\nThe mini recorder UI still has some choppiness/frame drops during state transitions (recording → transcribing → enhancing → idle), even after optimizations.\n\n## Investigation findings from this session\n\n### What we fixed\n- Removed overlapping `withAnimation` calls (was creating animation conflicts at 60fps)\n- State changes to `.transcribing` immediately after `stopRecording()` (was freezing on last audio frame)\n- UI dismisses before paste operations (was showing stale state during DispatchQueue delays)\n- Added hysteresis gate + envelope follower for visualizer (eliminates flicker)\n\n### Remaining issues\n- Frame drops still occur during state transitions\n- Feels like UI rendering is coupled to background processing\n\n### Potential causes to investigate\n1. **Main thread blocking**: State machine operations may be doing work on main thread during transitions. Check `WhisperState.toggleRecord()` and `transcribeAudio()` for any synchronous work.\n\n2. **SwiftUI view recreation**: The conditional `if/else` in `RecorderStatusDisplay` destroys and recreates views on state change. We tried ZStack with opacity but it was worse (all views running simultaneously). Maybe `@ViewBuilder` or `.id()` tricks could help.\n\n3. **NSHostingController recreation**: `MiniWindowManager` destroys and recreates the entire NSHostingController on show/hide. This is a hard reset that may cause frame drops.\n\n4. **Audio meter update rate**: Updates at ~60fps via `onChange(of: audioMeter)`. During state transitions, these updates may conflict with SwiftUI's layout system.\n\n5. **Model context operations**: `modelContext.insert()` and `save()` happen during the transition. Could be blocking.\n\n### Ideas to try\n- Profile with Instruments (Time Profiler, SwiftUI) to find actual bottleneck\n- Move more work off main thread with `Task.detached`\n- Use `CADisplayLink` for visualizer instead of `onChange`\n- Investigate if the window panel itself has rendering issues\n- Consider pre-creating all UI states and just switching visibility","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"31774+flowerornament@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-14T16:16:34.333829-08:00","created_by":"Flower Ornament","updated_at":"2026-01-14T16:16:34.333829-08:00"}
